"# backgroundswitch" 

Hi! There are only two files you should concern yourself with here:

1. Settings.exe
This is used to set your folder path from where the images will be pulled.
Double click to launch and follow the instructions.
Feel free to change the folder path whenever you please!

2. BackgroundSwitch.exe
After you have configured your settings, simply double click to change your background!
Please feel free to create a shortcut for this app to place on your desktop/pin to the taskbar.
If you'd like, you can use the icon included in the directory for the shortcut as well, just for aesthetic reasons.
Do NOT move any files out of the folder, although you can save the entire folder (and any shortcuts you create) anywhere.
